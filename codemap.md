# Repository Atlas: techhub-dns

## Project Responsibility
Implements the TechHub delivery workflow platform: a React operations SPA backed by a Flask API that ingests Inflow orders, coordinates QA and delivery/shipping workflows, generates and prints picklists/order documents, and integrates with Microsoft services for identity, storage, email, and notifications.

## System Entry Points
- `README.md`: Product overview, architecture diagram, stack, and local/deployment setup.
- `frontend/`: Vite + React + TypeScript SPA served in production from `frontend/dist`.
- `backend/app/main.py`: Flask application factory/entrypoint, Socket.IO wiring, blueprint registration, SPA serving, and `/health`.
- `backend/run_scheduler.py`: Standalone scheduler runner for Inflow sync, webhook health, and maintenance jobs.
- `backend/wsgi.py`: PythonAnywhere WSGI entrypoint.
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: PythonAnywhere deploy orchestration for migrations, frontend build, and webapp reload.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pythonanywhere.yml`: CI/CD handoff into the remote deploy script.
- `ops/print_agent/agent.py`: Standalone workstation print agent for picklist jobs.

## Architecture Shape
- `frontend/` owns the operator-facing UI, auth bootstrap, routing, and real-time UX.
- `backend/app/` owns HTTP/WebSocket APIs, business logic, SQLAlchemy models, and shared helpers.
- `backend/alembic/` owns schema migration bootstrap and history.
- `backend/scripts/` and `scripts/` provide operational and deployment automation.
- `ops/print_agent/` is a decoupled edge worker for physical printer execution.

| `ops/` | Operational namespace for standalone infrastructure that sits outside the main web app runtime. | [View Map](ops/codemap.md) |
| `ops/print_agent/` | Printer-side worker that claims backend print jobs, downloads PDFs, prints through SumatraPDF, and reports status. | [View Map](ops/print_agent/codemap.md) |

## Cross-Repository Flow
1. Inflow data enters the backend through scheduled syncs or signed webhooks.
2. Service-layer logic persists and transitions orders, producing audit/status history and delivery/shipping side effects.
3. The frontend consumes REST and Socket.IO updates for operator workflows.
4. Document and notification flows branch into PDF generation, Graph email/Teams/SharePoint operations, and optional print-job queueing.
5. The standalone print agent claims queued jobs from backend APIs and executes physical printing on workstation hardware.

## Operational Integration Points
- Database state is shared between Flask runtime, scheduler jobs, and operational scripts through `backend/app/database.py` and SQLAlchemy models.
- Microsoft integrations are centralized in backend services and surfaced through orders, auth, notification, SharePoint, and observability routes.
- PythonAnywhere deployment flows from GitHub Actions to `scripts/deploy.sh`, which migrates the DB, builds the SPA, and reloads the site.
